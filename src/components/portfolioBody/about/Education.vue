        <p>
            For the past couple years I have been taking classes through Palomar College to see what the world of web development and tech was like.
            I first started with a certificate program for web development and learned many of the basic skills needed to code such as basic html, css and javascript. When I had finished, I felt that this was definitely a career I could see myself thriving in so I decided to continue my education by completing an associates degree. From there I delved further into more advance classes and refined my skills in coding. Although I may have completed both a cerficate program and an associates, there is always more to learn!
