        <h4>What Did I Accomplish There?</h4>

        <p>
            As an intern for RipeMetrics I was given many resouces and experienced guidance in how a developer operates in a working environment. On a day to day basis I worked in an linux environment for version control (git) using my own isolated branch to submit changes to the master repo for review. When I first started working at RipeMetrics we did not have a cloud9 so we had to setup our own work environments on our laptops. This was a learning experience for me in that I was able to learn how to do this complicated setup on my own for future purposes but also see what it takes to create a developer's environment from scratch. Eventually we did switch over to cloud9 and ever since I have been working in that environment. The API I worked on for RipeMetrics used Vue.js and Bootstrap for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. Being brought in as a full-stack intern I had the unique opportunity of being the first intern to ever work in the backend.

            One of the best parts of being in this internship was being able to meet other people working in the same workplace environment that I have become accustomed to. Doing most of my schooling online, I never really had the chance to meet other people who are also on the path of becoming a web developer. It was great being able to do paired programming and see how other people approach the same challenge with different eyes or even teach you new things you never knew. Luckily I also got to meet and work with interns following different but highly relevant career paths such as the people on our UI/UX team. Being in contact with them on a daily basis and seeing their perspectives on developing the same project we are working on have taught me the value of working in an agile environment. Considering how much I grew from the time I started, I can honestly say that I was very fortunate to be a part of RipeMetrics team!
