            <h5>What Did I Accomplish There?</h5>

            <p>
                As an intern for RipeMetrics I was given many resources and experienced guidance on how a developer operates in a working environment. On a day to day basis I worked in an linux environment for version control (git) using my own isolated branch to submit changes to the master repo for review. When I first started working at RipeMetrics we did not have a cloud9 so we had to setup our own work environments on our laptops. This was a learning experience for me in that I was able to learn how to do this complicated setup on my own for future purposes but also see what it takes to create a developer's environment from scratch. Eventually we did switch over to cloud9 and ever since I have been working in that environment. The API I worked on for RipeMetrics used Vue.js and Bootstrap for the frontend and Laravel for the backend. Being brought in as a full-stack intern I had the unique opportunity of being the first intern to ever work in the backend.
